The food here is amazing. The chicken marinade is on point, and the chunks of chicken are very tender. The rice and salad are also quite good and balance out the bowl. This is definitely one of the best tasting fast casual bowls I've had.

4.7

of 5 stars [...] Absolutely delicious! I ordered the beef kebab bowl, it was a great portion for the value, side salad was fresh, rice was very tasty as well as the tender meat. I also ordered the lentil soup, and it was fantastic! The mint lemonade was very refreshing, too. All the food traveled well, with no spills, the packaging was perfect! I recommend this place 100%. I'll try other stuff in the future. First time trying because a neighbor always recommends this place. Very satisfied!
