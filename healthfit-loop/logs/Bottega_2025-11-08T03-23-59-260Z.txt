The sauces and meatballs were underwhelming. The pasta was passable but did not feel fresh. The portions were small and inadequate. The tiramisu was placed on top of hot items despite being a cold dessert. I would never order here again.

Amazing food. Great service. But I wish the portion size for the Sacchetti was larger. Counted only 10 pieces. Expensive meal for a small portion. But taste wise it was10/10.
